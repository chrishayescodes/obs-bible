# Current Sprint - Custom Messages System

**Sprint Duration**: 8 weeks  
**Start Date**: 2025-01-31  
**Target Completion**: 2025-03-28  
**Sprint Goal**: Implement complete Custom Messages System with sub-tab interface and markdown support

## Sprint Overview

This sprint focuses on adding a powerful Custom Messages System to the OBS Bible application. The feature will enable users to create, manage, and display custom markdown messages alongside Bible verses, with a sophisticated sub-tab interface within the Messages tab.

## User Stories in Sprint

### Epic: Custom Messages Foundation

- **CM-002**: As a content creator, I want to use markdown formatting so I can create visually appealing messages
- **CM-003**: As a frequent user, I want to save messages to a library so I can reuse common content

### Epic: Message Management
- **CM-004**: As a user with many messages, I want to search and filter my library so I can quickly find specific content
- **CM-005**: As a multi-device user, I want message changes to sync across tabs so all displays stay coordinated
- **CM-006**: As a data-conscious user, I want to export/import my messages so I can backup and restore my content

### Epic: Enhanced Display System
- **CM-007**: As a viewer, I want custom messages to display with same transitions as verses so the experience is consistent
- **CM-008**: As a mobile user, I want the message editor to work well on small screens so I can create content anywhere
- **CM-009**: As an accessibility user, I want full keyboard navigation so I can use the system without a mouse

## Sprint Backlog

### High Priority (Must Have)
- [ ] Sub-tab interface within Messages tab (Create | Library)
- [ ] Markdown editor with live preview
- [ ] Message library with search and filtering
- [ ] Cross-tab synchronization for all message operations
- [ ] Integration with existing OBS display system

### Medium Priority (Should Have)
- [ ] Message tagging and organization system
- [ ] Import/export functionality for message backup
- [ ] Usage tracking and analytics
- [ ] Auto-save and draft functionality
- [ ] Mobile-optimized editing experience

### Low Priority (Could Have)
- [ ] Advanced markdown syntax support (tables, etc.)
- [ ] Message templates and quick actions
- [ ] Bulk operations for message management
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Advanced filtering options (date ranges, etc.)

## Technical Debt & Refactoring

### Code Quality Improvements
- [ ] Extract sub-tab pattern into reusable component for future features
- [ ] Standardize localStorage utilities across all features
- [ ] Improve error boundary coverage for new components
- [ ] Optimize bundle size with tree-shaking for markdown dependencies

   - Mitigation: Implement message cleanup, compression, pagination
   - Owner: Development Team
   - Status: Plan created

2. **Mobile Editing UX Complexity**
   - Risk Level: Medium
   - Mitigation: Simplified mobile interface, touch-optimized controls
   - Owner: UX/Development Team
   - Status: Wireframes needed

3. **Cross-Tab Sync Performance**
   - Risk Level: Medium
