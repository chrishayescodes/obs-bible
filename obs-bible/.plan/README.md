# OBS Bible Application - Feature Planning

This directory contains comprehensive planning documents, specifications, and feature tracking for the OBS Bible application.

## Purpose

The `.plan` folder serves as the central hub for:
- **Feature Specifications**: Detailed markdown documents outlining new features
- **Architecture Documentation**: High-level system design and component interaction
- **Development Roadmaps**: Phased implementation plans and milestones  
- **Progress Tracking**: Current status of features and development tasks
- **Historical Record**: Archive of completed features and their evolution

## Development Guidelines

### Creating New Features

1. **Specification**: Create detailed spec in `.plan/features/[feature-name].md`
2. **Architecture Review**: Document component interactions and data flow
3. **Implementation Planning**: Break feature into development phases
4. **Progress Tracking**: Update status in relevant planning documents
5. **Completion**: Archive completed feature specs with final documentation

### Documentation Standards

- Use clear, consistent markdown formatting
- Include code examples and data structures
- Provide visual mockups or ASCII diagrams where helpful
- Document integration points with existing systems
- Maintain backwards compatibility considerations

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case for all filenames (`custom-messages.md`)
- Include version numbers for major spec revisions (`custom-messages-v2.md`)
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate content
- Group related documents in appropriate subdirectories

## Integration with Development

The planning documents should be:
- **Referenced** during implementation for accuracy
- **Updated** as features evolve during development  
- **Archived** when features are completed
- **Linked** from code comments and documentation where relevant

This planning system ensures thorough documentation, clear development direction, and historical tracking of the application's evolution.
