  "Ps.133.1": "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!",
  "Ps.133.2": "It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;",
  "Ps.133.3": "As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore."
