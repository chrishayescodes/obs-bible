  "Deut.9.5a": "Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the Lord",
  "Deut.9.5b": "thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the Lord sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.",
  "Deut.9.6": "Understand therefore, that the Lord thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people.",

  "Deut.9.7b": "didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the Lord.",
  "Deut.9.8": "Also in Horeb ye provoked the Lord to wrath, so that the Lord was angry with you to have destroyed you.",
  "Deut.9.9a": "When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the",
  "Deut.9.9b": "Lord made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:",
  "Deut.9.10a": "And the Lord delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all",
  "Deut.9.10b": "the words, which the Lord spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.",

  "Deut.9.12a": "And the Lord said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of",
  "Deut.9.12b": "Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.",
  "Deut.9.13": "Furthermore the Lord spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:",
  "Deut.9.14": "Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.",
  "Deut.9.15": "So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.",
  "Deut.9.16": "And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the Lord your God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the Lord had commanded you.",

  "Deut.9.18a": "And I fell down before the Lord, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink",
  "Deut.9.18b": "water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger.",
  "Deut.9.19": "For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the Lord was wroth against you to destroy you. But the Lord hearkened unto me at that time also.",
  "Deut.9.20": "And the Lord was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.",
  "Deut.9.21a": "And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very",
  "Deut.9.21b": "small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.",
  "Deut.9.22": "And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth–hattaavah, ye provoked the Lord to wrath.",
  "Deut.9.23a": "Likewise when the Lord sent you from Kadesh–barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you;",
  "Deut.9.23b": "then ye rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.",
  "Deut.9.24": "Ye have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew you.",

  "Deut.9.26b": "which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.",
  "Deut.9.27": "Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:",
  "Deut.9.28a": "Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the Lord was not able to bring them into the",
  "Deut.9.28b": "land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.",
  "Deut.9.29": "Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm."
